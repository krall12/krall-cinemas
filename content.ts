        testimonial: `Megan (Krall Cinemas) is an amazing videographer! She made a video for my elopement and it was beyond perfect. I contacted Megan with only three weeks before my wedding day (due to Covid we had to change our wedding plans quickly) and she was able to accommodate our date perfectly! She captured every detail so beautifully, and when my husband and I watch it, we are able to remember all our favorite, special moments of our day so perfectly. It seriously brings me to tears when I watch it. She has such a creative gift, and it is shown in her work! She is also super friendly and made the whole process of being recorded super comfortable- I didn’t even realize she was there most of the time- in a good way! The turn around time was also very quick for the video, which was great because I was so excited to see it!! I highly recommend Krall Cinemas to anyone wanting a wedding video or for any special moment you want to remember forever. She is the best!`,

Originally, we agreed that Megan would simply provide us with the raw footage, but to our surprise Megan went the extra mile and put a highlight video together for us, and it was stunning, just like all the footage she captured.`,

Even with our tight deadline (booked the weekend before my wedding) you made the process so easy. Now, the videos... OMG, you nailed it. We are emotional watching the teaser and the highlights. With very little guidance you knew the moments that would "pop" the video outside of the typical shots, great job. Your speedy service is very much appreciated. Thank you Megan.`,
